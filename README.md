# What?
My submission for the [dh-fastest-code-contest](https://github.com/rep-movsd/dh-fast-code-contest)

# why?
In the words of our lord and saviour Ash Ketchem, "gotta catch em all, (algorithms)"

# How
I'm using two algorithms simultaneously: linear probe and kd-tree based range lookup. I've done some thresholding and fine-tuning, and I think the current implementation gives a well rounded performance for most of the seeds. I wanted it to be much more faster, but alas, I'm still nowhere near the speeds of compiled language implementations.
